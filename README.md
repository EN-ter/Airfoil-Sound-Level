# Airfoil-Sound-Level
Model to predict sound level (Decibels) of airfoil based on frequency angle of attack, chord length, free stream velocity, and suction side displacement. 

# Scenario
The company prides itself in being able to efficiently design airfoils for use in planes and sports cars.For this project use the modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. Clean this dataset, create an ML pipe line to create a model that will predict the SoundLevel based on all the other columns, evaluate the model, and persist the model.
